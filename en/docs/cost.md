## Beta test - *free*
At the moment the product is provided **free** and with **full functionality** (all components).      
We provide an opportunity to join testing and development.     

**Use, leave suggestions, report problems found.**    

## What happens when the beta test ends?
Once out of beta, current agents will not be immediately disabled.     
We will contact all active clients, warn about the need for payments and find a suitable method.          
      
_Estimated end of beta-testing is **November 2023**_     

### What will be the cost?
Basically pricing for agent: **$0.01** for each one interface/ONU (everything counts - active, inactive, disabled, PON port, etc.);     
For the duration of the subscription, you can receive software updates and support.     
       
Minimal step for count interfaces - **1000**     
For example, if you have 300 interfaces, you can buy agent for interfaces - 1000 minimal(10$ per month).     
Also, if you have 10001 interfaces, you must buy subscription for 11000 interfaces minimal.     
   

**Optionally, you can connect additional functionality (does not depend on the number of interfaces):**
 
- ONU registration on Huawei/ZTE - 10$/month
- Links and network topology - 10$/month
- Pon-boxes - 5$/month
- Sending notifications - 5$/month

**The subscription can be as:**     

- monthly     
- annual (with discount 10%)     
 
**Example of cost calculation:**     

- You have 4500 interfaces     
- You want to use additional functionally as ONU registration and notifications     

Cost for month: (5000 * 0,01$) + 10$ + 5$ = 65$      
Cost for annual: ((5000 * 0,01$) + 10$ + 5$) * 12 * 0,9 = 702$    


## Support during the beta test
We are constantly working on improving the system and documentation, but some points may not be entirely clear or complicated (for example, setting up an ONU registration).
If you have trouble setting up, need advice or help, you can:

* Contact our telegram channel - [https://t.me/wildcore_dms_channel](https://t.me/wildcore_dms_channel)     
* Contact the developer individually - [@WildcoreSupport](https://t.me/WildcoreSupport)      

## Development order
If you need an **individual** solution (for example, integration with self-written billing, other services)    
or there is no desire / opportunity to expect the introduction of equipment or certain functionality, but you need it here and now - there is the possibility of paid development.
