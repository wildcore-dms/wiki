!!! question "More about PWA"
    * What is it? - [wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application)
    * How to install? - [support.google.com](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop)

!!! info "Optimization of ONU/interface loading speed"
    Optimization is achieved through caching survey results in interface slices.
    Therefore, when opening ONU, some data will be taken from the cache, and some from the equipment.
    To see which methods are from cache and which are from equipment, check in the "Hardware Calls" block.
